# ⛏️ Card NFT Forging / Leveling

#### 🏋️ Progression & Game Loop

* Players complete missions → Earn CORE → Buy Packs → Build Decks
* Cards gain XP by participating in combat
* Cards level up to 25 through usage in PvP
* Once a card reaches level 25, it can be forged into an NFT using CORE
* Forging resets the card’s level and grants it a golden frame, viewable in inventory and during combat
* Players must have a wallet linked to forge an NFT. Attempting to forge without one will route the player to wallet linking flow

**Card Leveling Mechanics:**

* Every card owned by the player has an individual level
* Monster cards gain XP while on the field
* When a monster delivers a killing blow, it earns `killedMonster.mana × 5` XP
* All allied monsters currently on the board also gain **half** that XP
* This mimics a team-based XP system, rewarding strategic play and field presence
* Once at level 25, the card will stop gaining XP until it is forged

**NFT Forging System:**

* Cards forged as NFTs are permanently gold-framed
* Forged cards are tradeable on the FM marketplace
* Forging cost increases globally with each new forged copy of the same card, making early mints more valuable
* Players are encouraged to specialize and level cards that fit their strategy
