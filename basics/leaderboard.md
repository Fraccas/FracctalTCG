# 🥇 Leaderboard

#### 🏅 ELO Ranking System

* Fracctal TCG uses an ELO-based rating system to match players of similar skill levels in ranked PvP.
* Winning a match increases your ELO, while losing decreases it.
* The amount of ELO gained or lost depends on your opponent’s rating: defeating stronger opponents earns more, while losing to weaker ones costs more.
* New players start at a baseline ELO and quickly rise or fall to their appropriate skill bracket.
* ELO ensures fair matchmaking, skill progression, and competitive balance in leaderboards.
