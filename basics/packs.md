# 🎁 Packs

#### 📦 Packs

* Packs can only be opened using [CORE](currencies.md).
* Each pack contains **5 cards**.
* Packs may be **themed by element** (e.g., Fire, Water, Shadow) or **untyped by rarity** (e.g., Common Pack, Rare Pack, Epic Pack).
* Untyped rarity packs offer broader variety with weighted rarity drops.
