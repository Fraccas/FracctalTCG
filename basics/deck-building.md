# ⚒️ Deck Building

#### 🃏 Deck Building

* Decks must contain **at least 20 cards**.
* Players can build decks using a mix of **Web2 cards** (earned through gameplay) and **Web3 NFT cards** (purchased or forged).
* Decks may include cards of different types and elements (teams), allowing for strategic variety.
* Certain cards, such as **Locations** and **Towns**, reward thematic synergy by providing bonuses to cards from the same element.
* NFT cards feature **gold frames** and are visually distinguished during combat.
