### üé® NFT Integration

#### üè∞ NFT Forging System

* Cards can be leveled up to 25.
* At level 25, players can spend CORE to forge the card as an NFT.
* Forging resets the card‚Äôs level.
* Each additional NFT minted for a card increases the fee globally.
* Forged NFTs have a golden frame and show in both the card view and board view.
* Forged cards appear in the FM site inventory and can be traded on the FM marketplace.\\
