# ðŸŽ® Core Gameplay Mechanics

#### ðŸ“ˆ Overview

Fracctal TCG is a cross-platform trading card game (TCG) designed to be fair, engaging, and optionally powered by blockchain. Players can earn and spend in-game currencies, participate in balanced ranked PvP, and convert digital assets to NFTs. The game supports both Web2 (traditional) and Web3 (blockchain-enhanced) experiences without sacrificing fairness or accessibility.

**Elemental Teams (Factions)**

There are 8 elements that define deck-building synergy and card effects:

* **Plant:** Resilient survivors who heal, grow stronger over time, and overwhelm with natural regeneration.
* **Fire:** Aggressive powerhouses focused on rapid attacks, spell damage, and overwhelming force.
* **Water:** Adaptive strategists who flood the field, cycle resources, and outlast through constant motion.
* **Rock:** Durable juggernauts with armor, heavy hitters, and death-defying defenses.
* **Ice:** Tactical controllers who freeze enemies, delay threats, and turn the tide with devastating storms.
* **Electric:** Unpredictable assaulters who amplify speed, stack buffs, and shock enemies with sudden bursts.
* **Shadow:** Deceptive saboteurs who curse enemies, strike from stealth, and sap strength over time.
* **Psychic:** Masters of mana acceleration, board manipulation, and hand disruption.

Decks typically focus on one or two elements to maximize synergy and benefit from aura and support cards tied to specific teams.
